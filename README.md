# Lumio Pet Companion

Lumio Pet is a wellbeing companion app that schedules small tasks, captures your mood, and grows alongside you. This guide focuses on what you can do inside the app.

## Getting started
- Open the app and follow the onboarding steps. Pick a username that uses only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
- Allow notifications so Lumio can alert you the moment a new task slot is generated. You can later toggle notifications per slot (morning/afternoon/evening) in **Settings → Notifications**.
- Enable location and weather access to receive weather-aware activities and reminders.

## Daily flow
1. **Automatic task generation** – Tasks are generated for each time slot based on the day’s schedule and weather. Unlock notifications fire as soon as a slot is ready, even if the app is in the background.
2. **Complete a slot to keep your streak** – Finishing every task in any single slot counts as a streak day. You do not need to clear all slots.
3. **Mood capture** – After completing tasks, share how you feel so the app can adjust future suggestions.
4. **Rewards** – Completing tasks earns energy and occasional snacks for your pet. View insights in the Statistics tab.

## Chatting with Lumio
The in-app chat is powered by ChatGPT with short-term memory of your current conversation. Type how you’re feeling or what you need; Lumio responds with weather-aware, supportive replies.

## Export and import
- **Export**: Go to **More → History**, tap **Export last 30 days**, then share the generated `.xls` file. The spreadsheet includes tasks, moods, and energy events.
- **Import**: In the same view, tap **Import .xls/.xlsx** and pick a compatible file to merge historical data back into the app.

## Tips
- Turn notifications on for slots that match your routine; you can disable others to reduce noise.
- Username changes should stay within letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens to keep profiles clean.
- If you open the app after a scheduled slot, pending tasks are generated automatically and notifications are rescheduled so you never miss the next slot.
